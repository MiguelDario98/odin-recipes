    <h1>Mapo Tofu Recipe</h1>
    <img src="./images/mapo tofu.jpg" alt="Mapo Tofu">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mapo tofu is a popular Chinese dish from Sichuan province known for its fiery bright red sauce. The classic recipe is made with simmered silken tofu flavored with ground pork or beef, fermented bean paste (douban and douchi), chili oil, and Sichuan peppercorns. The dish is spicy, aromatic, deeply flavorful, and has a unique numbing character imparted from the Sichuan peppercorns.</p>
    
    <p>While the Sichuan-style mapo tofu is known for its boldness and intensity, the Japanese version has a milder character as it has been adapted to the Japanese palate. Nevertheless, Japanese mapo tofu is still packed with lots of umami— thanks to the layering of flavors. Also, the spice level is tamed. <strong>If you’re looking for a not-spicy mapo tofu, this recipe is for you!</strong></p>

    <h3>Differences betweem Chinese and Japanese Mapo Tofu</h3>
    <p>There are many versions of mabo dofu within Japan and each household cooks it differently.</p>
    
    <p>So what ingredients do we use in the Japanese mabo tofu that are not included in the original Chinese mapo tofu? The majority of mabo dofu in Japan includes miso, mirin or sugar, sesame oil, oyster sauce, and occasionally sake.</p>

    <p>Most distinctly, Japanese mabo dofu doesn’t include any chili or Sichuan peppercorn. The only “spicy” element comes from doubanjiang, spicy bean paste. However, if you can find a Taiwanese brand of doubanjiang, you can buy a non-spicy doubanjiang (豆瓣酱) or spicy doubanjiang (辣豆瓣酱) with red chili in it. More about it in the next section.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 knob ginger</li>
        <li>2 green onions/scallions</li>
        <li>14 oz soft/silken tofu (kinogoshi dofu)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp neutral-flavoured oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola etc.</li>
        <li>1/2 lb ground pork (you can also use other meat and veggis of your choice)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the Seasonings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2-1/2 Tbsp doubanjiang (spicy chili bean sauce/broad bean paste) ((or a mixture of 1½ Tbsp doubanjiang (non-spicy) and 1 Tbsp la doubanjiang (spicy))</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp miso</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp oyster sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp roasted sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp potato starch or cornstarch</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp water</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all the ingredients</li>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients for the seasonings (the doubanjiang, mirin, miso, oyster sauce, soy sauce, sesame oil, cornstarch, and water) in a bowl and mix well together.</li>
        <li>Mince the garlic cloves and ginger finely.</li>
        <li>Cut the green onions into small pieces. Drain the tofu and cut into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes.</li>
        <li>In a large frying pan, heat the vegetable oil on medium heat and sauté the garlic and ginger. Make sure you don't burn them. Once they are fragrant, add the ground pork and break it up with a spatula or wooden spoon.</li>
        <li>When the meat is no longer pink, add the seasonings mixture and stir thoroughly. Bring the sauce to a boil</li>
        <li>Once the sauce is boiling, add the tofu and gently coat it with the sauce. Stir frequently, without mashing the tofu, until it is heated through. Add the green onions and stir to incorporate just before taking the pan off the heat. Serve immediately.</li>
